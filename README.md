This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Flutter Android builds

The Flutter companion app lives in `piro_momo_games`. Run the helper script to produce both a release APK and App Bundle:

```bash
./scripts/build-android.sh
```

The script installs dependencies, runs `flutter build apk --release`, and then `flutter build appbundle --release`. Artifacts land in:

- `piro_momo_games/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
- `piro_momo_games/build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

Add your keystore + `android/key.properties` so the release output is signed; otherwise Flutter generates an unsigned build and the script will warn you.
