# Tihar (तिहार) - Nepal’s Festival of Lights: A Deep Dive into Five Days of Joy

## Introduction to Tihar

Tihar, or तिहार, is Nepal’s dazzling five-day extravaganza that lights up the country like a million fireflies! Held in Kartik (October-November), this “Festival of Lights” is a vibrant mix of rituals, family love, and tasty treats. Picture this: oil lamps (diyo) flickering on every doorstep, kids singing “Deusi-Bhailo” in Kathmandu’s narrow alleys, and dogs wagging tails with tika on their foreheads. Tihar isn’t just a festival—it’s a Nepali way of saying “thank you” to animals, siblings, and the goddess of wealth, Laxmi. Let’s unpack its magic, day by day!

## The Story Behind Tihar

Tihar’s roots lie in Hindu mythology. It’s tied to Yama, the god of death, and his sister Yamuna. Legend says Yamuna prayed for Yama’s long life, asking him to visit only after her rituals—tika, garlands, and prayers—were done. This became Bhai Tika, Tihar’s emotional peak. But Tihar isn’t just Hindu—it’s a Nepali festival, with Newars, Gurungs, and others adding their own twists. In 2025, expect Tihar around late October—Kartik’s dark nights will glow brighter than ever!

## Day 1: Kaag Tihar – Honoring the Clever Crow

Tihar kicks off with Kaag Tihar, the day of crows. In Nepal, crows aren’t just noisy birds—they’re messengers of Yama. On this day (Kartik Krishna Trayodashi), families wake early, cook rice with ghee, and mix in bits of meat or dal. They place it on banana leaves or old plates, shouting “Kaag, kaag!” from rooftops or courtyards. In villages like Bhaktapur, some even toss food mid-air for crows to snatch! Kids love watching these black visitors swoop in—it’s a quirky tradition that sets Tihar’s tone.

## Day 2: Kukur Tihar – Nepal’s Dog-Loving Day

Next up is Kukur Tihar, a day that melts every Nepali heart. Dogs—strays or pets—are stars on Kartik Krishna Chaturdashi. Families garland them with bright orange sayapatri (marigold) flowers, dab red tika on their foreheads, and feed them meat, eggs, or milk-soaked roti. In Kathmandu, you’ll see street dogs wagging tails near Pashupatinath, while in Pokhara, pet owners snap selfies with their pups. The Nepal Army even honors its guard dogs with ceremonies! It’s a day of love for our four-legged friends—don’t miss the adorable pics on #KukurTihar!

## Day 3: Gai Tihar & Laxmi Puja – Cows and Cash

Day three is a double treat! Mornings start with Gai Tihar, honoring cows as Laxmi’s earthly form. In rural Terai or hilly Lamjung, farmers wash cows’ hooves, paint their horns with red mud, and offer grass mixed with rice bran. By evening, it’s Laxmi Puja—Tihar’s brightest moment. Homes in Patan or Biratnagar glow with clay diyas (some use 108!) along windows, doors, and rooftops. Rangoli designs—swastikas, lotuses, or peacocks—dot floors, made with rice powder, abir, and sindoor. Families chant “Om Jai Laxmi Mata” while offering coins and sel roti to Laxmi’s idol. Kids hit the streets singing “Bhailini ailani, laxmi puja garna bolani”—and neighbors reward them with khaja or coins!

## Day 4: Goru Tihar & Mha Puja – Oxen and Newar Pride

Day four celebrates oxen and Newar identity. In farming villages like Kavre, oxen get tika, rice flour dough balls, and a rest from plowing—it’s their thank-you for tilling fields. Meanwhile, Newars mark Mha Puja, a soul-cleansing ritual. In Bhaktapur’s Taumadhi Square, families sit in mandala circles, lighting oil wicks (ita) and eating sagan (boiled egg, fish, and ginger). The priest chants “Swasti na indra,” blessing each person’s spirit. It’s a deep, beautiful tradition—Newars say it’s like a personal New Year!

## Day 5: Bhai Tika – Sibling Love in Full Color

Tihar ends with Bhai Tika on Kartik Shukla Dwitiya, the festival’s emotional climax. Sisters draw a protective circle around brothers with mustard oil, then apply a seven-color tika—red, yellow, blue, green, white, orange, and pink—using a grass blade. In Kathmandu’s Thamel, you’ll see brothers munching walnuts and sisters gifting scarves from Asan’s stalls. The tika plate overflows with makhamali garlands, almonds, and sel roti. Brothers offer cash (Rs. 100 to thousands!) or gifts like earrings. In Terai, Maithili families add fish to the feast, while Gurungs in Gorkha might include raksi. No siblings? Cousins or neighbors step in—everyone’s family on Bhai Tika!

## Tihar Food: A Flavor Explosion

Tihar’s kitchen is a busy place! Sel roti—crisp, ring-shaped rice doughnuts—fry in every home, paired with spicy achaar. In the east, anarasa (rice flour sweets) rule, while Newars in Lalitpur whip up yomari (steamed rice dumplings with molasses). Kheer, khuwa, and jerry sweets tempt kids, and goat curry or duck roast spices up Bhai Tika. In colder hills like Mustang, warm raksi flows freely. Hungry yet?

## Tihar Vibes: Lights, Songs, and Cards

Tihar transforms Nepal! In Pokhara, Lakeside sparkles with fairy lights, while Ilam’s tea gardens glow with diyas. Firecrackers crackle (though quieter now—eco-warriors prefer sparklers). “Deusi-Bhailo” echoes everywhere—groups sing “Tiharai aayo, laxmi puja garau hai,” dancing with madals and jhyaali. Card games like flush or marriage heat up late nights—don’t bet your whole dakshina!

## Shopping and Prep

Weeks before, markets like Kathmandu’s Ason bustle with sayapatri flowers (Rs. 50-100 per mala), diyas (Rs. 5 each), and rangoli colors. In Birgunj, traders stock sweets from India—gulab jamun, anyone? Homes get a deep clean—cobwebs out, Laxmi in!

## Tihar Today: Tradition Meets Change

Tihar’s adapting! In cities, LED lights replace diyas, and animal lovers push for gentle Kukur Tihar celebrations. Bhai Tika gifts now include phones or watches—Rs. 500 notes feel old-school! What’s your Tihar twist?

## Why Tihar Steals Our Hearts

Tihar is Nepal’s soul on display—five days of lights, love, and laughter. From crows cawing for rice to sisters praying for brothers, it’s a festival that binds us to nature, family, and tradition. So, light your diyo, fry some sel, and sing “Deusi re”—Tihar’s here to make Nepal shine!
